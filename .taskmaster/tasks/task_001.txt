# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Unit Testing Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure the existing ThirdOpinion.Common.UnitTests project with xUnit testing framework and Shouldly assertion library, establish testing structure and conventions
# Details:
1. Add xUnit and Shouldly NuGet packages to the existing ThirdOpinion.Common.UnitTests project
2. Verify test project references to all ThirdOpinion.Common.* projects are properly configured
3. Setup test naming conventions (ClassName_MethodName_ExpectedBehavior) in the existing test project
4. Create base test classes if needed for common setup within ThirdOpinion.Common.UnitTests
5. Configure code coverage tools (coverlet or similar) for the existing test project
6. Setup CI/CD pipeline integration for running tests in ThirdOpinion.Common.UnitTests
7. Create test data builders/object mothers for common test scenarios within the existing test project structure

# Test Strategy:
Verify that ThirdOpinion.Common.UnitTests project can reference all main projects, xUnit test runner discovers tests correctly in the existing project, Shouldly assertions work as expected, and code coverage reports are generated successfully for the unified test project
