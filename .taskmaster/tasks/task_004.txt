# Task ID: 4
# Title: Test S3 Storage Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create unit tests for S3 storage service, URL generation, and S3 reference handling
# Details:
1. Test S3Storage implementation:
   - Upload file operations
   - Download file operations
   - Delete operations
   - List objects functionality
   - Stream handling
2. Test S3UrlGenerator:
   - Presigned URL generation
   - URL expiration handling
   - Different HTTP methods (GET, PUT, DELETE)
   - Custom headers and metadata
3. Test S3Ref:
   - Reference parsing and validation
   - Bucket/key extraction
   - ToString formatting
4. Mock IAmazonS3 client
5. Test error scenarios (network failures, invalid buckets, access denied)

# Test Strategy:
Mock S3 client responses for all operations, validate URL format and expiration times, test file size limits and content type handling, verify exception handling for S3 service errors
